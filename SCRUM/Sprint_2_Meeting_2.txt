Minutes from Previous Meeting
Kiran was successful in testing the YouTube API; given a specific word, the API generates a link to
a YouTube video that pertains to that word. Jackson and Mahirah were able to create a Google
Firebase real-time database that stores all the user’s flashcards information in a tree-like
structure. The user’s IP address is used at the user’s identity, under which are the folders that
the user created. Each folder contains a set of flashcards. Several calls to this database are made
each time the user uploads files or routes into a folder. Mahirah implemented displaying these
folders in the web application.
