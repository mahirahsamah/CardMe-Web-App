Minutes from Previous Meeting
Objectives from the previous meeting were moved forward in order to allow for the completion of
the Sprint 1 document and materials. The team is still on track to complete items on time as
progress during Sprint 1 was ahead of schedule. Moving forward, the objective to store flashcards
in the user’s cache was abandoned in favor of a Google Firebase database, which Mahirah and Jackson
will implement. It was also decided to implement an API for searching relevant YouTube videos,
rather than the Quizlet API. Kiran will work on implementing  this.
